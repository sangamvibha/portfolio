                        The purpose of this assignment was to explore the rich and diverse world of tea and present the
                        provided information through engaging infographics. The primary goal was to introduce the
                        intricacies of tea to a layman, offering a visual and informative journey into its origins,
                        varieties, cultural significance, and more. Additionally adhering to the font and colour usage
                        limitations provided.

                <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
                <p>The following step involved comprehensive research on the provided information and seeking out
                    suitable images for reference in alignment with the task. For example, when investigating the
                    tea-making process, research was done to acquire references and enhance comprehension of the
                    procedure. This was undertaken to cultivate a deeper understanding of the provided concept and
                    facilitate thorough coverage of the topic.</p>

                <h2>LAYOUT</h2>
                <p>Different layout options were explored to identify the most suitable one that best emphasized
                    hierarchical elements.</p>

                <h2>ILLUSTRATION</h2>
                <p>I proceeded to create illustrations and icons specifically tailored for the infographics, simplifying
                    the original reference images into more streamlined forms. Selecting a color palette was crucial,
                    with a maximum allowance of five colors. I opted for a serene and earthy palette, inspired by the
                    tranquil surroundings of tea plantations nestled in the hills. Additionally, the illustration style
                    was intentionally kept organic, avoiding clean, straight lines for a more raw and natural aesthetic.

                <h2>TAKEAWAY</h2>
                <p>As the project neared completion, the final step involved assembling all elements within the
                    compositions. However, this stage presented challenges, particularly in integrating text alongside
                    illustrations. While the illustrations offered visual cues, strategic placement of textual elements
                    proved essential. This experience underscored the importance of meticulous layout planning. Despite
                    initial reservations about pursuing infographics instead of my desired elective, the entire process
                    proved to be an immensely enriching experience. From digital design to printing on A2-sized paper,
                    the process afforded invaluable insights. I grappled with ratio sizing nuances and color fidelity in
                    print, while also recognizing the impact of font size on readability.The transition from digital
                    creation to physical printing unveiled distinct considerations, highlighting the unique intricacies
                    involved in both processes.</p>
